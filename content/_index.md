## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.png" >}}

> The goal of the architect is to create a shape for the system that recognizes policy (business rules and procedures) as the most essential element of the system while making the details irrelevant to that policy. This allows decisions about those details to be delayed and deferred.

These words of Robert Martin are a guide for me. I'm not interested in being the best Go / Php / Java programmer or a Kubernetes / MySQL / Elasticsearch / Symfony guru: these are just details for me.

I want to design systems that give maximum value to my business, that are able to scale, that are flexible and quick to change and reliable, using the right trade-offs.

I like to be in close contact with the various stakeholders and customers, in order to understand the real needs and how to make an impact.

## Experience

### Senior Backend Software Engineer at [ProntoPro](https://prontopro.it)

#### Apr 2021 - Present

As a senior software engineer with an _ad interim_  role as lead of the Backend Chapter, the main responsibilites are:

- Leading the technical recruiting step for Backend roles.
- Contribute to the shaping of new projects: collaborate in defining specifications, identify "rabbit-holes", define "no-goes".

### Backend Software Engineer at [ProntoPro](https://prontopro.it)

#### Jun 2019 - Apr 2021

I work on new features of the product and on enhancing the Backend system in general. Here are some relevant activities:

- Search Engine Result Page (SERP): gives consumers the ability to search and filter between ~ 1M professionals from ~ 1k of different kind of jobs in six coutries. It's a Go microservice, receiving data from a monolithic Php application via RabbitMQ messages, storing them and making them searchable in Elasticsearch. It also calculates job prices using Elasticsearch aggregations.
- Authentication System: allows our clients to authenticate using the OAuth 2.0 + OpenID standards. It runs on a custom Go microservice for the Identity Provider part and on [ory/hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra) for the OAuth 2.0 + OpenID flow orchestration.
- Online badge: stores and exposes the online status of the professionals. It's a Go microservice that receives professionals heartbeats sent by FE clients, stores them in Redis (until they expire) and exposes an online status for professionals.
- Many features related to our core monolithic application. It runs Php 7.4 application with Symfony 4.4. Having huge tables and high availability requirements I had to manage database schema/data migrations without downtime and queries optimization (MySQL 5.7 and Doctrine).
- Enhancement of DevOps: CI/CD (using Drone), infrastructure (Kubernetes with Helm Charts), dev-environment (docker-compose).

ProntoPro is an amazing startup, full of very talented people from whom I learn a lot and with great challenges to deal with on a daily basis. Here I learned to work in an agile paced, remote oriented and cloud-first environment, to communicate in English on a daily basis, to measure between quality and velocity, to build stuff that scales, is reliable and maintainable, to avoid breaking changes, to use KISS, SOLID, DDD, TDD, to have useful retrospectives to improve Cycle after Cycle, to follow solid coding principles and enforce them through CI and Code Reviews.

### Backend Software Engineer at Accenture
#### Oct 2018 - Apr 2019
I worked as a consultant for the Italian traffic police. I managed the technological modernization of a complex legacy system for the management of manual and automatic fines. Java with Swing framework and Oracle DB were the technology used.
